# `itzibitzi.js`

Based on previous experience, I decided to reimplement the challenge in JavaScript.

The plan is as follows:

1. Set up `node.js` project.
2. Create simple echo service.
3. Port the tests from Haskell to `jest`.
4. Implement the `eval` function for flatten.
5. Add negative tests: multiple objects, no object, no object
6. Add type annotations for TypeScript.


17:23 Create repo, write `Readme.md` with plan.
19:25 Echo server mostly done.  Investigating how map over object.
